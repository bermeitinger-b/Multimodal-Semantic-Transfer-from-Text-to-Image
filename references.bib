  abstract = {This paper presents an ontology created for classifying and researching material culture and its visual representations, that forms a part of an emerging data-driven research framework on Neoclassicism (ca. 1760\textendash{}1860). The framework, named Neoclassica, unites a top-down approach to knowledge discovery, represented by the Neoclassica-ontology, with innovative methods and techniques for processing multimodal data corresponding with a bottom-up approach. Below we will first describe the Neoclassica framework, discussing the epistemological considerations related with it. Second, we outline the basic objectives of the ontology and explore differences to existing thesauri, as well as relationships with existing standards (CIDOC-CRM). Third, we will give an overview of the most important classes currently provided by the ontology and illustrate the features of the multilingual approach and the descriptive power already inherent to the ontology. Finally, we will give an outlook on the next steps for developing the Neoclassica framework.},

  abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

Distributional models build semantic representations by extracting co-occurrences from corpora and have become a mainstream research paradigm in computational linguistics. In this review, I present the state of the art in distributional semantics, focusing on its assets and limits as a model of meaning and as a method for semantic analysis.},

  abstract = {We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},
